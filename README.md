## Description

FlowingData recently posted [*Optimized Brewery Road Trip, With Genetic Algorithm*][1], in which they map out an optimal path (minimizing total travel distance) for visiting the 71 US-based breweries that made it into the top 100 Best Brewers in the World list from RateBeer in 2018.

[The Brewers Association][2] shows that there are 8,993 breweries in the US (as of 2019-02-21) and there seems to be a lot of wasted travel if you only visit the top 71 breweries on a tour around the US. Can we find an optimal path for visiting all of these breweries? How many additional miles would we end up driving? How much additional time would it take?
